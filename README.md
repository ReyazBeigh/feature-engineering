# Feature Engineering - Better Features make better models
## What is Feature Engineering?
- The goal of feature engineering is to make your data better suited to the problem at hand. We do this to `1 - improve models predictive performance`, `2 - reduce computational or data needs`, `3 - improve interpretability of the results`
